# teamProfile-generator

This project generates an html file that holds information about your development team provided through the console. On the command line after the program has been initialized, the user will go through a series of prompts starting with information about the manager of the team. Once that information has been inputted, the user will be asked whether they want to add an Engineer, an Intern or if they would like to finalize their team.<br>
After adding all team members, the html file will generate automatically.<br>
This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & Node.js with the Inquirer package serving as the user interface in the terminal.

Here is a sample of what the final html file will look like:

Here is a walkthrough video showing the process of initializing the program, walking through the prompts, finalizing the html file, running the corresponding tests for each class and opening the html file in the browser:
